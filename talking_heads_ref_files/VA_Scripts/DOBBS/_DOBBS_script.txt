DOBBS1 - Oh, my head.
DOBBS2 - I-I'm Dobbs... Private, First Class.
DOBBS3 - I was in a battle. Yes, a battle. There was gunfire and explosions everywhere. People dying. I was scared but I had to keep on fighting. Then there was this blinding flash.
DOBBS4 - The next thing I remember was seeing my body as if I was looking down at it from above. I heard the doctors say I was dead and then they threw my body onto a pile of other bodies.
DOBBS5 - Some men came by and took my body to a laboratory. I heard them say something about trying to regenerate my body by immersing it in something called Biomed Gel.
DOBBS6 - And then I woke up here. I have to go! I have to get back to my unit.
