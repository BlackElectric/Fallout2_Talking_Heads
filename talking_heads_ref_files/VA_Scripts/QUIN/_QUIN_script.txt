QUIN1 - Name's Quincy, soldier. Why are you tapping my shoulder and looking lost?
QUIN2 - All right, but make it quick. I have inventory to do.
QUIN3 - What do you need to know?
QUIN4 - This is maintenance. We repair pretty much anything except for the vertibirds.
QUIN5 - They only fit in the hangar or outdoors. You figure it out from there, okay?
QUIN6 - Well... I've got a copy of the plans but I can't just hand them out to anyone who asks for them. What do you want with them?
QUIN7 - Down south... Holy shit! We've got a spy here! Guards! Alert!
QUIN8 - You're one round short of a full clip, aren't you? Well, they call you grunts for a reason. Look, Einstein, I can't give you the plans without authorization, okay? So, go back to whoever sent you here and get the proper paperwork.
QUIN9 - Look, Einstein, I can't give you the plans without authorization, okay? So, go back to whoever sent you here and get the proper paperwork.
QUIN10 - A tech told you... You mean Raul? Did he send you?
QUIN11 - Damn it! You know, Raul would lose his head if it weren't placed so firmly up his ass! This is the third time this quarter that he's lost those plans! And now he doesn't even have the brass bouncing balls to come to me and ask for them? Fine, they're in the locker over there. Oh and, when you deliver them, tell that asshole I want to see him.
QUIN12 - So you're back. Did you get the authorization?
QUIN13 - You again? What is it now?
