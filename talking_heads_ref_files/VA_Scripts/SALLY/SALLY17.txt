Hmm, I don't know if Jenny will even take you in the condition that you're in. You're going to need a thorough, no-nonsense, scrubbing first. (To herself: I wonder if Gerda is free for that?) With the cost of the pre-scrubbing, the Round-the-World Full Squeaky Clean Servicing is yours for only $185.
