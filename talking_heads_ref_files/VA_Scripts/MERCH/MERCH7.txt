Hmm... the connectors are shot on the main motor, eh? Well, I got some wires here with me that will work, but not that specific motor. I am sure Vault City has the part though. Go there and speak with Harry in the main courtyard. Tell him Dave sent you. Damn motor is expensive, but he should give you a good deal.
