MERCH1 - Ah, what a piece of shi- umm, I'm a little busy right now. Do you need something or are you just wasting my time?
MERCH2 - Heh, "having trouble" is an understatement. This ol' thing is totally busted. There's no way it's going to run again.
MERCH3 - The main water pump for the Abbey is busted. The damn thing was breathing its last the past few days and now it's finally gone out.
MERCH4 - Sure, be my guest. Not like you could break it any more.
MERCH5 - Sure, no one's stopping you.
MERCH6 - Oh, it's you again. Any luck?
MERCH7 - Hmm... the connectors are shot on the main motor, eh? Well, I got some wires here with me that will work, but not that specific motor. I am sure Vault City has the part though. Go there and speak with Harry in the main courtyard. Tell him Dave sent you. Damn motor is expensive, but he should give you a good deal.
MERCH8 - Any luck on that part? This machine won't fix itself.
MERCH9 - Excellent. Want me to install the damn thing, or do you want the pleasure?
MERCH10 - Alright fine, hand it over.
MERCH11 - (Wipes the sweat from his forehead.) Yeah, need something?
MERCH12 - [He squints at you for a moment, then slowly lets out his breath in a sigh.] Sorry friend, this thing's being a real bitch, and it's gotten me all worked up. I didn't mean to snap at ya. 
MERCH13 - Alright, I wouldn't expect someone to do work for free. The part will cost you bout 500 and I think 100 more for your trouble is reasonable. Here's 600.
