ANNVV1 - Why hello there, I'm Connar's wife, Ann. You must be the one who helped us out. I can't tell you how much we appreciate all you've done. It's hard to believe that we can finally live in peace without fear of Vault City's goons coming to take us from our homes.
ANNVV2 - Actually, I *could* use some help. Now that we're becoming more organized, we're starting to see our numbers grow. The problem is, I'm not sure we'll have enough food to go around. My husband has attempted to get the caravans to stop here, but they don't' think we're worth their time. I don't suppose you could get them to reconsider?
ANNVV3 - One of the caravan masters, Mr. Baron, will be passing by here shortly. The caravan trail isn't far from this village. If you could go out there and meet with him, we'd all appreciate it greatly.
ANNVV4 - Are you ready to go meet the caravan master yet?
ANNVV5 - Oh, it's you! Thank you for speaking with Mr. Baron. He had just come by to make trade arrangements with my husband. You've done so much to help us, we're forever in your debt!
ANNVV6 - [Ann looks a bit flustered.] Well, yes... alright fine. I had a little something stored away for an emergency, but I suppose you can have it. And to think I saw you as a good person.
ANNVV7 - Oh, it's you! I heard what you did to Mr. Baron. I never did care for him, but you didn't have to kill him. We'll stifle as a community without proper trade.
ANNVV8 - Hello again.
ANNVV9 - How did it go?
ANNVV10 - What!? You realize this was our last chance to make arragements with him. We look like fools now standing him up. You've doomed us.
