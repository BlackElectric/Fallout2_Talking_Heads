Actually, I *could* use some help. Now that we're becoming more organized, we're starting to see our numbers grow. The problem is, I'm not sure we'll have enough food to go around. My husband has attempted to get the caravans to stop here, but they don't' think we're worth their time. I don't suppose you could get them to reconsider?
