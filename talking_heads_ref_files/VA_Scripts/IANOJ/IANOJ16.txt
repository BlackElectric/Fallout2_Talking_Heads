That, I'm not sure about. A bunch of ghouls came by with them. They were carrying strange amulets and talking about some "Renewal". That's pretty much all I know. You might wanna check out Gecko though. That place is bustling with ghouls. Speaking of big rats, did I ever tell you about the time the Vault Dweller and I went to Vault 15?
