Hey, I'm just as confused as you are. Who knows? Maybe it's got something to do with all that radiation I was exposed to back in the old days. Hell, when we went to the Glow, I remember the Vault Dweller was popping Rad-X like candy, but did he offer any to ol' Ian? Of course not. I think he was still upset over a little friendly fire mishap. Heh heh. [Sigh.] Those were some good times.
