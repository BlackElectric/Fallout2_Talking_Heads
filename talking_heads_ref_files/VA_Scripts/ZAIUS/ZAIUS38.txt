Well, as the mutants are not only getting old and senile -- the gas keeps them young, or something -- I'd have to say things are pretty good. I mean, we don't want to kill everyone, and as far as I can tell, the humans don't think too poorly of us. 'Course, that's not including the humans from the other places around here... now those are some bastards.
