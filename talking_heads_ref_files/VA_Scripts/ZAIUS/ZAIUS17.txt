Great! You'll need the parts, of course. Go to New Reno and look for Renesco. He's got tools lying around the shop. Tell him Zaius sent you. Tell him that I said, "The canary's kicked the bucket." I don't know where to get protective equipment for the gas. I suppose you could go in without any but you'll be hurting. Again, thank you.
