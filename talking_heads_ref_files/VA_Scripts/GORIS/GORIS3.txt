So you've talked with Gruthar. He has a rather inflated opinion of me. I don't really know half as much as he thinks I do. Anyway... So you're an outsider! I've seen a few like you; some are staying here in the vault, but you look different. You appear to be more 'seasoned,' if you know what I mean. I'll bet you've been around a bit and accomplished things. Am I right?
