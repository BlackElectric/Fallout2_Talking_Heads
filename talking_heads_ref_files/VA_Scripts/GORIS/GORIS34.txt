I'm sorry to have deceived you, but humans have a habit of shooting deathclaws on sight. I felt that it would be to my advantage to hide my identity until you could see for yourself that I am on your side in this venture. If you want me to leave, I'll do so. But I would rather stay and help you on your quest. I want to show that humans and deathclaws can work together as friends, not enemies.
