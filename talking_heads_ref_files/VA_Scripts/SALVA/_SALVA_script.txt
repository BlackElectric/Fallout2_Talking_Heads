SALVA1 - (Salvatore turns to you with a stone-faced expression. He studies you for a fraction of a second, then makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)
SALVA2 - (The elderly man looks up at you. His face is gaunt and covered with liver spots. He is holding a breathing mask, which is connected to an oxygen tank by his side.) What... do you want of me?
SALVA3 - I have told you the reason the boy was killed. It will not leave this room. (Salvatore makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)
SALVA4 - (Salvatore studies you for a fraction of a second in disgust, then makes a strange motion with his hand. Instantly, an alarm rings throughout the casino.)
SALVA5 - (Takes a deep breath from his mask, then shakes his head.) You have nothing... that I need to know, Traveller. Now... what do you WANT of me?
SALVA6 - (Looks at you silently for a minute. He might be either amused at your question or irritated... it's hard to tell.) Again, Traveller: What... do you WANT of me?
SALVA7 - (Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of... course you are. And WHY should I hire you?
SALVA8 - (Takes a breath from the oxygen mask, then gives a slight smile.) Of... course. But I require a... token of your good faith. A sample of your... willingness to work for me.
SALVA9 - (Shakes his head slightly.) Your naiveté has... no place here. Words are not sufficient: You wish to work for Louis Salvatore? Then I must know how much I can rely on you.
SALVA10 - (Takes a deep breath from the oxygen mask.) There is... a man... who has used his... skill with cards to rob me. The sum is... trivial. The insult is not. I want him killed and the money he stole returned.
SALVA11 - Mason will have... the details. (Nods at exit.) Go now.
SALVA12 - Then you are of... no use to me. Leave now.
SALVA13 - (Narrows his eyes. His next words are delivered in a rasping hiss.) ::You have not yet PROVEN yourself.:: Now go see Mason. He will have the... details of your assignment.
SALVA14 - (Salvatore looks up at you, takes a breath from the mask.) Have... you disposed of the thief?
SALVA15 - Yet... you told Mason that you had taken care of the assignment.
SALVA16 - (Puts his fingers together.) And... the money. Has it been recovered?
SALVA17 - Your instructions were to recover the money he stole. Have you not done this?
SALVA18 - I will take the money now.
SALVA19 - This amount... is not the amount that was stolen from me. Perhaps you don't know how much was stolen from me. Or perhaps you are holding out on me. Either way...
SALVA20 - (Salvatore nods as you give him the money, but he holds up his hands halfway through the transaction.) The... remaining half is yours.
SALVA21 - (Mr. Salvatore takes a breath from the mask.) I have another... matter that requires your attention.
SALVA22 - A constituent in my... district has not paid me... tribute... for the services I provide. Collect it. If he objects, inform him you are my... representative in this matter. Talk to Mason for the details.
SALVA23 - You are... lying to me. I know that he still lives.
SALVA24 - Have you done as I asked?
SALVA25 - You told Mason you had collected my tribute. Have you not done this?
SALVA26 - Very well. (He waits.)
SALVA27 - This amount... is not the amount that was stolen from me. Perhaps you don't know how much the required tribute is. Or perhaps you are holding out on me. Either way...
SALVA28 - (Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done... well. You have earned 25% of the cut.
SALVA29 - (Salvatore nods as you give him the money.) You have done... adequately. You have earned 10% of the cut.
SALVA30 - (Takes a breath from his mask.) You have... done as I asked. I have no further need of your... services. (Points to the exit.) Leave now.
SALVA31 - (Takes a deep breath from the mask.) I have another... matter that I could use your assistance with.
SALVA32 - A... sensitive transaction will be taking place soon. I am in need of an extra... guard to insure that the transaction goes smoothly. You will speak with Mason and do as he directs you.
SALVA33 - Mason will have... the details. Go now.
SALVA34 - Yesss. This time, yes. But you will carry other armaments as well. Talk to Mason about the details. He will give you one of the lightbringers.
SALVA35 - Sit, Traveller. You have done... all I have asked. I would like you to join the Salvatore Family and become... one of my made men.
SALVA36 - That is... unfortunate. I cannot take the risk that you will remain... silent about what you have seen in the desert. Goodbye, Traveller.
SALVA37 - (Nods) That is a... good name. Now go speak to Mason. He will have...something for you.
SALVA38 - (Mr. Salvatore looks at you for a long time in silence, then speaks.) We Salvatores... we will rule New Reno. If a child must die to insure that, it will be... done. There is no other reason.
