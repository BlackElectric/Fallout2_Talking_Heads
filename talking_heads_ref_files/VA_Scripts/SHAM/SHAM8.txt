There's an *actual* lost spirit roaming the woods just south of the village! It's true, I've seen her with my own eyes--a pretty girl with the blank look of the dead. The sight chilled me to the very core. The moment I saw her I pissed myself and ran as fast as I could. The others expect me to go back and guide her into the mists, but how can I? I'm too petrified to go near her again.
