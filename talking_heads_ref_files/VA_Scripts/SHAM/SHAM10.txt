Well, up until just recently I was merely the underling of the village shaman. That was easy, I just had to follow his lead. Then he went for a drunken midnight swim in the Great Salt Water and, well, I suddenly found myself promoted. I didn't think it would be so bad. I figured I could just spout off some mystical mumbo-jumbo and everyone would be happy. But no. The very day that I acquire the title of shaman I find myself dealing with something that's way over my head.
