BMATT1 - Greetings, friend. I don't think I have seen you around here before. My name is Brother Matthew and I help spread the word about the importance of preserving the knowledge of the old ones.
BMATT2 - A GECK, huh? I seem to remember reading something about that during one of my transcribing sessions. So it must be in our database, but I'm afraid access to our computers is restricted. However, if you talk to the Abbot, it's possible he'll grant you access. It couldn't hurt to try, anyway. Oh, and feel free to browse through our collection of holy pre-war relics. I'd ask you not to damage anything, but I'm afraid everything's already broken beyond repair.
BMATT3 - I am at your service. What would you like to know?
BMATT4 - The Abbey is home to anyone, so long as they don't cause trouble. We are an independent community and rarely get visitors, such as yourself. The majority of those you see here are descended from the original founders that settled in this old monastery not long after the great Flame Deluge.
BMATT5 - The quiet, peaceful quality of this place has made it an appealing home to other travelers that have wandered here over the years, seeking to escape from the dark chaos of the wastes. Of course, the true value of this place lies in its vast library. It's filled with old tomes, containing the strange wisdom of a lost age. Over time, we've come to fancy ourselves the keepers and guardians of that wisdom.
BMATT6 - [The man chuckles at your question] No, no particular reason. I have just read much poetry throughout my life and I enjoy applying it to my teachings. It helps leave a greater impact on those listening.
BMATT7 - It is good to see you again Child. What can I do for you?
