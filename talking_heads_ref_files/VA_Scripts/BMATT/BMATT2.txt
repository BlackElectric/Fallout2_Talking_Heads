A GECK, huh? I seem to remember reading something about that during one of my transcribing sessions. So it must be in our database, but I'm afraid access to our computers is restricted. However, if you talk to the Abbot, it's possible he'll grant you access. It couldn't hurt to try, anyway. Oh, and feel free to browse through our collection of holy pre-war relics. I'd ask you not to damage anything, but I'm afraid everything's already broken beyond repair.
