Well, people always talk about Vault City taking over to get our gold. Or one of the families in New Reno getting everyone hooked on their dope in order to take over. Or even the NCR wanting to annex us. I tell you, the NCR's our best bet - but they're all just out for our gold. Redding's still independent, so far.
