My father was contacted by Dr. Raynard Muldrake, an old colleague he had worked with during his time in the States. Dr. Muldrake urgently requested a private meeting, but my father was in poor health at the time and was in no condition to travel to America. Dr. Muldrake agreed to meet me in his place.
