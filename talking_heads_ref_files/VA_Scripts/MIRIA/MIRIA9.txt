Ah, Rose. The proprietor of Rose's Bed and Breakfast. Now, you didn't hear it from me, but have you ever wondered why her 'coop' is so well protected? She says it's to protect her chickens from predators, but if you look closely it looks as if she's trying to keep something in rather than out. Plus, whoever heard of chickens laying twelve pound eggs?
