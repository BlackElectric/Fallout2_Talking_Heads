The wife and I came here a few years ago on a caravan. We liked it here so much we decided to stay and start our own little farm. Let me tell ya, the Abbey might not be as flashy as New Reno, or as advanced as Vault City, but as far as I'm concerned, this place is about as good as it gets in the wastes. The folks here are decent, and people look out for one another. Sure, some places might offer more safety, but at the cost of personal freedom. No thank you.
