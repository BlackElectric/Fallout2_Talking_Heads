After that, I asked Brother Samuel if anything had happened in the graveyard. That's when he told me someone had begun digging up some of the graves. Apparently, whoever's doing this isn't strong enough to dig in one night. I'd guess it's an old beggar hoping to dig up some treasure. If you ever find out who's doing this, please tell 'em to stop by. There's no need for thievery here in the Abbey and I'd be happy to help this person in any way I can.
