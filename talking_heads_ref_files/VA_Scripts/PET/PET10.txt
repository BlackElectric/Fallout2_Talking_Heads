Well, the next night we didn't hear a thing. But the night after that, we heard rustling coming from the field again. This time I crept to the window and looked out rather than rushing outside. Peering into the darkness, I saw a dim light, like from an old lantern or something, moving among the crops. After a couple minutes the light moved toward the cemetery.
