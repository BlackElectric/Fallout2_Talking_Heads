Sorry pal, I've never heard of it. But if it has to do with pre-war times, then I bet there's something about it in the monastery's computers. Unfortunately for you, those monks are real protective of their information--afraid that it'll lead to another war or something if people learn too much. Still, it might be worth asking around there.
