Not really. The Abbey's too small and isolated for the caravans to pay us much heed. Doesn't matter though, we're a pretty self sufficient community -- grow our own food, brew our own booze -- so we get by just fine. Anyway, Bill's the man to speak to about caravans, he runs the general store just southwest of here.
