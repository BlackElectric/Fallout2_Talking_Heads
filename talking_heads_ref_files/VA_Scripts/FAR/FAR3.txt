Not again! How many people is Cornelius going to send over to look for his watch? I didn't do it! In fact, I was probably the victim of the same thief. Around the same time his watch disappeared, some of my tools were stolen. I'm sure you don't believe me, so you might as well have a look around, otherwise you'll never go away. Well, go on!
