DALIA1 - Hi. I'm Dalia. What can I help you with?
DALIA2 - Well, hello to you. Now, I'm sorry, but you should go.
DALIA3 - I said I'm Dalia. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I don't want to talk to anyone right now. Okay?
DALIA4 - I like the fresh air, I like the trees, so I'm standing here. Do you have a problem with that?
DALIA5 - No, I'm not guarding the trail. There's nothing in this hole worth guarding. I told you, I'm enjoying the fresh air. Now go away.
DALIA6 - Hi. I'm Dalia. What can I help you with?
DALIA7 - I see people go by here every day. I really don't pay much attention to them.
DALIA8 - I don't give a radrat's ass... I'm sorry. I'm just a gun who was hired to stand here and guard this trail. Other than that, I don't know what's going on around here. I had a daughter once, though, and... yeah, some guy went by here. I let him through because he knew the proper sign... just like the sign you gave me. Go on. I'm outta here. 
DALIA9 - Then go the hell away and leave me be!
