I don't give a radrat's ass... I'm sorry. I'm just a gun who was hired to stand here and guard this trail. Other than that, I don't know what's going on around here. I had a daughter once, though, and... yeah, some guy went by here. I let him through because he knew the proper sign... just like the sign you gave me. Go on. I'm outta here.
