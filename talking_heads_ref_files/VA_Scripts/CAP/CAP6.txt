This ship's a Poseidon tanker. It's equipped with tech that lasted through the war. It's got a FOB that allows access to the navigation computer room, and its got an IFF transponder that protects it from Poseidon guns. Course, that ain't gonna help you any against that old Chinese sub, so you best hope that thing's as dead as she looks.
