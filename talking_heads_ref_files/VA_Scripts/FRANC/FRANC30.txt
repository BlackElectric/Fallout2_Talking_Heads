If you talked to some of the people in town about your hatred of mutants,  you'd find out about the conspiracy. I know two wrongs don't make a right, but I call it self-defense. I did something wrong, and I admit it. I can't stay here. I'll set out to find a way to atone for my actions... That satisfy your sense of justice?
