ZOMAK1 - Renew, comrade! I am Zomak. Some call me Zomak the Destroyer. What is your business here?
ZOMAK2 - Renew, comrade! What are you doing here? State your business to Zomak the Destroyer.
ZOMAK3 - You should look somewhere else, or Zomak will show you the stars.
ZOMAK4 - Then you must see him.
ZOMAK5 - He is the granter of enlightenment. It is he that promises Renewal to all who follow him.
ZOMAK6 - Well, he's right back... Hey! Just who are you, anyway?
ZOMAK7 - Well, wander on out of here, then.
ZOMAK8 - Well, in that case... Come on in. He's right in the next room. Don't keep him waiting.
ZOMAK9 - Well, you should choose to leave. Get out of here.
ZOMAK10 - Yes, you can all Renew inside.
ZOMAK11 - Ook? What do you mean by that? Are you dumb?
ZOMAK12 - Get out of here. The Brain doesn't have time for the likes of you.
ZOMAK13 - There's nothing else down here but the Brain's lair. Boy, are you dumb.
ZOMAK14 - Oops. Uh, there's nothing here. Nothing at all. Just go away now.
ZOMAK15 - Yup. I'm sure. Now get out.
ZOMAK16 - Oh, heh, heh... yeah. I knew that. Umm, well, er, did I pass? 
ZOMAK17 - Okay, then. You can go right in.
ZOMAK18 - You have the sign. Go right in.
ZOMAK19 - Yes, the sacred talisman of Renewal. Renew, comrade! Renew!
