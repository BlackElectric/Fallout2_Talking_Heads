I am AHS-7, the second in command of this facility. Before you ask: AHS stands for Aligned Hub Seeker, which means that I have cleared seven levels of neurodynes from my spirit. This means that I am more enlightened and closer to the hub of the Great Wheel than you. And this means that you will tell me what you want here. Now.
