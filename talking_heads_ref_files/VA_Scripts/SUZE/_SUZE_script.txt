SUZE1 - Did Badger send you? I knew he would. I'm so relieved.
SUZE2 - Oh, you poor dear. Radiation and the wasteland aren't nice, are they? I hope someone can help you.
SUZE3 - It's kind of stupid, really. I was just exploring because Badger was on the computer and I went downstairs and got lost and then next thing you know, I'm surrounded by monsters. Good thing you came along.
SUZE4 - I found the room I was in. I also found a room that looked like a fueling area. I didn't get much farther because of the monsters.
SUZE5 - I'm from a place south of the Boneyard and south of the Glow. We're not too far from the sea. I used to be a nanny, but then the kids mutated into monsters.
SUZE6 - He came down south and went to a club I used to go to. So, when things fell apart for me, I thought this would be the place to go.
SUZE7 - You saved my life. I'll answer any questions you have.
SUZE8 - Oh my god... Badger is dead... I don't know what I'll do... I haven't got any friends here... all my family is dead... oh my god...
