I thought they were up to their usual tricks! My poor little Torr, what bullies those boys were. Well, that explains what's been spooking Torr, but I wish there was more proof that it was the Duntons. I'm afraid word of mouth just isn't good enough. And now that the Duntons are dead, I'm not sure if we'll ever get to the bottom of this. But if you come up with anything else, please let me know.
