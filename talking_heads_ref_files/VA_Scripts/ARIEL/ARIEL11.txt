My husband and I were traveling with a caravan on its way to the New California Republic. We wanted to start a new life for ourselves and our daughter, Sandy. Unfortunately, the caravan was attacked by raiders one night. They were incredibly brutal. They killed everyone: men, women, and children. Rand, my husband, died trying to defend Sandy and me. We were to die next when a miracle occurred.
