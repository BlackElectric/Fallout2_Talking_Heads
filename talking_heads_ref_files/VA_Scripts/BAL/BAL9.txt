Does that mean you'll help me? Thank you! Jonny was last seen playing cowboys and Indians with his dog Laddie out front. The two of them are inseparable; in fact, that's how we knew something was wrong. One day, Laddie came back without Jonny. We've been searching ever since. Take Laddie with you; maybe the two of you will be able to find Jonny.
