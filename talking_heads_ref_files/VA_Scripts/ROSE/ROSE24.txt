Oh dear! Have you been talking to my husband Cornelius? This whole business with the watch is just terrible. Cornelius has got the whole town believing that his best friend, Farrel, took his watch. If you've talked to him, I'm sure you've noticed his mind isn't quite functioning properly. I'm pretty sure the poor dear just left the watch somewhere and forgot where.
