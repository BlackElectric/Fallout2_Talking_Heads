After the Great War, the guiding hands of fate directed our ancestors to this old Abbey in the mountains. Due to its remote location, the monastery survived the Flame Deluge mostly unscathed. As our ancestors explored the building, they discovered an extensive library of books. And not just religious texts, oh no, this library contained the gamut of written works, from literary classics, to scientific encyclopedias.
