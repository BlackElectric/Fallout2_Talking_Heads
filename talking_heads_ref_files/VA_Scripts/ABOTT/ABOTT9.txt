You'd really do that? Perhaps while you're down there, you could look for a certain book. You see, it was last known to be in Brother Thomas's possession, and it's very important to us, as it was passed down by our founders. If you could retrieve that book, I would be most grateful. In fact, I'd grant you full access to our computers, so you can look for whatever you desire.
