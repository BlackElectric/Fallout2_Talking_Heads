Our holy mission is to read, copy and take care of our sacred books of knowledge and other relics of the lost age. It is our hope that with this knowledge we are able to create a Memorabilia that might one day help humanity emerge from its self-imposed Dark Age. Any information that we come across is recorded, lest it be lost like so much was in the great Flame Deluge.
