I do not know all the names of our founders, but the most important one I am aware of is Miller. Before the Great War he was an electrical engineer working for the United States government. Shortly thereafter, he converted to Catholicism and made an oath with himself that we would spend the rest of his life preserving the knowledge of the past. His greatest fear was that this knowledge would be lost forever and thus needed to be preserved so that future generations may benefit.
