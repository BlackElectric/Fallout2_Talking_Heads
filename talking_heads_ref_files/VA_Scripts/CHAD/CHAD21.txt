Oh yeah? Let me help. The documents you're looking for are in a briefcase that's locked away in the bottom drawer of that dresser over there. But you're never gonna touch it, 'cause I'm gonna kill you, you fuckin' do-gooder. If it weren't for you, I coulda kept skimming off the caravan runs for another couple months. But no, you had to go an' meddle in affairs that aren't any of your fuckin' concern. So now I gotta flee town, but at least I'll have the pleasure of leaving your corpse behind.
