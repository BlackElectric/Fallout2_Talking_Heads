QM21 - Who the hell are you guys... Alert! Intruders on the base!
QM22 - What the... I can see why you're here. You obviously want to get rid of that antique suit you're wearing.
QM23 - Why are you out of uniform, soldier?
QM24 - I'm busy right now. Come back later.
QM25 - Uh, what? Can't think of a good excuse? I'm waiting, soldier!
QM26 - You're a bit on the slow side, aren't you? (sigh) Well, that's not your fault. I have a brother just like you. Anyway, are you new here? I don't recall seeing you before.
QM27 - Are you new here? I don't recall seeing you before.
QM28 - Well, you'll need your standard issue, then. Go into the armory, suit up, and take your weapon. You should report to the Drill Sergeant afterwards.
QM29 - You're welcome. Now get out of here. I've got work to do and I don't want to be disturbed.
QM210 - Hello, recruit. I just got a call from your Sergeant. He says I'm to suit you up and send you back to him. That right?
QM211 - This base is on alert and I don't recognize you. Show me your papers, soldier.
QM212 - Wrong answer. You're to carry your papers with you at all times and you should know that!
