EW1 - (The woman jumps.) Oh, my! You gave me such a fright! (Squints at you.) Yes, yes?
EW2 - (Mrs. Wright jumps.) Oh, my! You gave me such a fright! (Squints at you.) Well, hello again!
EW3 - (Looks puzzled, then looks you over.) (Oh, you poor dear! Too much sun... (She fishes in her robes for a moment, pulls forth some items and presses them into your hands.) Here you go, dear. Take these.
EW4 - (Looks puzzled, then looks you over.) Oh, you poor dear... don't you have a home? (She fishes in her robes for a moment, pulls forth some items and presses them into your hands.) Here you go, dear. Take these.
EW5 - (Looks puzzled, then looks you over.) (Oh, you poor dear! Too much sun... (Fishes in her robes for a moment.) I wish I had some food or water for you...
EW6 - (Looks puzzled, then looks you over.) Oh, you poor dear... don't you have a home? (Fishes in her robes for a moment.) I wish I had some food or water for you...
EW7 - Why, yes, yes it is. (Smiles.) I am Missus Ethyl Wright, head of the Temperance Union here in New Reno. And who might you be?
EW8 - Me? Why, I am Missus Ethyl Wright, head of the Temperance Union here in New Reno. (Studies you.) And who might you be?
EW9 - Oh, my! You're a TRIBAL, aren't you? Your accent gave it away! (She raises her voice and starts speaking slowly.) WELL -- MAY I BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME YOU TO OUR CITY!
EW10 - I SAID, LET *ME*... (Points at herself.) ...WELCOME YOU... (Points at you.) ...TO... (Gestures at the city around her.) ...CITY OF LIGHTS!
EW11 - Oh! Excuse me! (Seems startled.) Pardons, pardons! It's just that I thought... well... nevermind, let's put that all behind us. What can I do for you?
EW12 - (Squints, frowns.) I'm sorry, the Garden of... what? No, I'm sorry, I've never heard of such a thing.
EW13 - Vault 13? (Looks puzzled.) My goodness, no, I haven't... well, no, wait. That's untrue. There IS Vault City to the northeast. Is that what you are looking for?
EW14 - Why, yes! (Wags her finger at you.) New Reno is a beautiful city, but there is SIN here - much of which can be traced back to the evils of alcohol... or as you tribesmen call it... (Pauses dramatically.) ...FIREWATER!
EW15 - (Rambles on.) The Temperance Union was established to help people turn away from the poison of drink and turn towards more hard-working pursuits.
EW16 - The Temperance Union was established to help people turn away from the poison of drink and turn towards more hard-working pursuits.
EW17 - (Looks shocked.) Surely you are mistaken. Even a primitive tribal such as yourself can't seriously mean th--
EW18 - By Richard Millhouse Nixon and his mother! I don't know what practices you tribespeople follow in your dens of iniquity, but in New Reno, things are changing! We are a CIVILIZED people!
EW19 - (Thinks.) Well, good Father Tully for one.
EW20 - (Thinks.) Well, good Father Tully was one of our members. Before he died.
EW21 - Now, you listen here. (Frowns.) I'm not going to tolerate that kind of slander. The good Father has had his struggles with alcohol, but through the help of the Union, he has fought for his soul and triumphed!
EW22 - Oh yes, he is a spiritual leader of New Reno. He runs the only Chapel in New Reno. You simply MUST speak to him. He is quite inspiring!
EW23 - Hmmph! Of all the crass rudeness! If you see me again, you had best simply pass by in silence.
EW24 - Why, yes, yes, he is. (Squints at you again.) I'm sorry, do you know my husband?
EW25 - (Jumps.) Oh, my! You gave me such a fright! (Squints.) Well, hello again!
EW26 - Oh. (Blinks.) So what is it I can do for you?
EW27 - So what are these questions you have?
EW28 - (Frowns.) Now what IS this foolishness you're speaking of? "Alcohol distribution in New Reno?" I know my husband is inclined to drink, but he IS breaking the habit...
EW29 - Why... my goodness! Of all the cheek! (Takes deep breath.) That is a VERY serious accusation, young man.
EW30 - Why... my goodness! Of all the cheek! (Takes deep breath.) That is a VERY serious accusation, young lady.
EW31 - No, YOU look! It's no secret that - in the PAST - my husband had a private still in the city. Nonetheless, he swore it was for his use only, and AT MY REQUEST, he has dismantled it!
EW32 - (Frowns, puts her hands on hips.) I will look into it, you can rest assured! And if I find that you are wrong, you had best leave this town! Meet me at the church tomorrow morning, and we will speak again.
EW33 - (Smile dies.) Yes, my son Richard... he... yes, he left us much too soon. I... hmmm. Yes. (Looks at her hands.) I...
EW34 - (Jaw tightens.) That filthy poison! I thought that I'd taught him to stay AWAY from that stuff, and then...
EW35 - I don't know! (Hands clench into fists.) They sell that poison on every corner here in New Reno! EVERYWHERE you go, they're peddling it...
EW36 - Not by name. They know enough to run when they see me coming... but they cluster like flies along Virgin Street at the front of town and outside the casinos.
EW37 - (Jumps.) Oh, my! (Squints at you, then purses her lips disapprovingly.) Well, I never! Keep your distance, you lust demon! You who fornicate on film for the corruption of the masses!
EW38 - (Jumps.) Oh, my! (Squints at you, then purses her lips disapprovingly.) Well, I never! Well, I never! You have some sand coming back around here! You who fornicate on film for the corruption of the masses!
EW39 - Out! Out of here at once!
EW40 - (Jumps.) Oh, my! (Squints at you, then her gaze travels to your slaver brand. Her tone becomes glacial.) Yes?
EW41 - (Jumps.) Oh, my! (Squints at you, then her gaze becomes glacial.) Yes?
EW42 - (Jumps.) Oh, my! (Squints at you, then her gaze becomes glacial.) You again. We have NOTHING to talk about.
EW43 - I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you. Good day.
EW44 - I see. Well, I'm afraid I can't help you. Good night.
EW45 - (You see Mrs. Wright. She looks crushed.)
EW46 - All true... everything you said was true. (Sighs.) The still was not dismantled. Not at all! (Frowns.) I trusted that man, but alcohol made him LIE to me! *Lie to his own wife!*
EW47 - (Smolders.) I will MAKE him keep the promise he made, if I have to destroy that still with my own hands. Then Orville and I shall have words! We'll see what that little weasel says then!
EW48 - You'll destroy it? I... well, all right... (Builds up steam..) Tear it down! Wreck it! Leave NOTHING!
EW49 - You'll destroy it? I... well, all right... (Builds up steam..) ...it's in the train station basement behind our home! Tear it down! Wreck it! Leave NOTHING!
EW50 - I will, by tarnation! (Rolls up sleeves. To your surprise, she has arms like a weight lifter.) Thank you for opening my eyes, stranger. I'll put my husband back on the straight and narrow, even if it KILLS him.
EW51 - (You see Ethyl. As you approach, she looks up hopefully.) Is it...?
EW52 - It's in the train station basement near our home! Tear it down! Wreck it! Leave NOTHING!
EW53 - (Tear wells up in her eye.) Thank you, stranger. You have dealt a blow to the evil here in New Reno. I don't know how to thank you...
EW54 - Then we can remedy that. Follow me.
EW55 - Here you go. Everything in this locker is yours. Some money to help you in your travels... and a handy tool that I have found useful in pounding sense into the particularly mule-headed. Thank you for all you've done.
EW56 - New Reno can't exist on gambling and alcohol and prostitution and expect to survive! Oh, no! Not while Ethyl Wright is at the helm, it won't! No, sirree!
EW57 - (Puffs up.) Perhaps it is standard practice in your tribes to slander others in public, but here in New Reno you have some sand coming up to me in public and speaking ill of my husband!
EW58 - Furthermore, he has resolved to help me and any other unfortunates addicted to alcohol break the habit. Shameful! To even SUGGEST my husband was selling the alcohol to others is...
EW59 - But now, I don't want you to hurt any of my children, no waving guns! They're not bad children, they've just been... misled. I'll have to see what I can do to change that...
