You need to have the Dermal Impact Armor installed before I can give you the Assault Enhancement. But I'll tell you what it should do. The Assault Enhancement should give you a total of 10% resistance to normal and explosive damage - over and above any other armor you're wearing. The operation takes a few days and it'll cost you $30,000. In addition, you're not going to be too Charismatic after I finish. Cramming all those impact plates under your skin is going to make you look pretty damn angular, but in a very streamlined way. But who doesn't like the way a new car looks - I'll try not to give you tail-fins.
