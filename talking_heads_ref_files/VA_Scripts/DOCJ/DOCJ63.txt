You need to have the Phoenix Armor Implants before I can give you the Assault Enhancement. But I'll tell you what it should do. The Assault Enhancement should give you a total of 10% resistance to thermal damage (fire, laser, and plasma) - over and above any other armor you're wearing. The operation takes a few days and it'll cost you $48,000. In addition, you're not going to be too charismatic after I finish. Layering all those thermal dissipaters under your skin is going to make you look a bit lumpy, sort of like an overstuffed burrito.
