According to what I've read, Dermal Impact Armor gives you 5% resistance to normal and explosive damage - over and above any other armor you're wearing. The operation takes about two days, one suit of Combat Armor (for parts), and it will cost you $5,000. This procedure should be fairly simple... I think. Hmm, you may not even scar all that badly.
