LENNY1 - Hello there, my name's Lenny. H'how can I h'help you?
LENNY2 - I hear that you're the Descendant of the Vault Dweller. You know, I met the Vault Dweller once.
LENNY3 - Hello ag'gain. How c'can I help you?
LENNY4 - Hello there. I j'just can't g'get over h'how much you look like the Vault Dweller. Wh'what c'can I do for you?
LENNY5 - Yes. What do you need?
LENNY6 - Y'you sh'shouldn't have left your village. G'go home now.
LENNY7 - A G'garden of Eden C'creation K'kit? I heard that Vault City had one of those. That's the only one I've ever heard of, though.
LENNY8 - W'well, I h'help H'harold mostly. Wh'when people get hurt, I h'help them out.
LENNY9 - I c'can h'help you. B'but it'll c'cost you $30. F'for supplies.
LENNY10 - L'let me t'take a look at that. I th'think I c'can help you.
LENNY11 - Your f'friend looks ok to me.
LENNY12 - Your f'friend is hurt. I can f'fix 'em up f'for $30. I n'need the m'money for s'supplies.
LENNY13 - What have you f'folks been up to. L'looks l'like you c'could really use some healing. I n'need to charge you $60 to heal everyone.
LENNY14 - Well, your f'friend c'could use a little h'help. I c'can h'help them though.
LENNY15 - L'look's like you f'found some kind of trouble to g'get into. I c'can fix them up, though.
LENNY16 - W'well. I didn't actually m'meet the V'vault Dweller. But I saw 'em. Once. 
LENNY17 - Well, b'before the W'war I w'was a doctor.
LENNY18 - That's t'true. B'but the radiation seems to have g'given us g'ghouls a longer life-span. 'Course, it took almost everything else away.
LENNY19 - W'well, y'yes. We look l'like f'friggin' f'freaks. We d'don't have any skin, for Chrisakes.
LENNY20 - Y'you c'could say that. I'd trade in all those years to b'be a n'normal person again.
LENNY21 - If those f'fools in Vault City w'would share their medical technology, I'm sure we could c'cleanse the excess r'radiation and heal ourselves.
LENNY22 - Y'you've been to Vault City? Then you t'tell me wh'what you think the chances of g'getting h'help from those bigots is. M'might as well watch a p'paper dog chase an asbestos c'cat through hell.
LENNY23 - N'no. L'life's too short -- heh, heh -- well, for m'most people -- to sweat the s'small stuff. Know what? It's all small stuff. This is f'free.
LENNY24 - I'it w'was a long time ago. In a place called N'necropolis. A lot of us g'ghouls lived there. One day, I saw someone running through the city.
LENNY25 - Yes, running. You see, we ghouls c'can't run too much anymore. So, I knew it was an outsider when I saw them. They ran by so close I could have touched them. I wish that I had joined the Vault Dweller....
LENNY26 - Yes. I h'had the chance of a lifetime and I blew it.
LENNY27 - L'later, I h'heard that the Vault Dweller had fixed our water system. The V'vault Dweller saved us -- all of us. Do you understand? It didn't matter that we were ghouls. For once it didn't matter. We w'were people again. W'worth saving.
LENNY28 - Later, I heard that the Vault Dweller destroyed the source of the m'mutant army. The Vault D'dweller saved all of us. Human and ghoul alike... I could have been a part of that, but I lacked the c'courage. I've never forgiven m'myself.
LENNY29 - I have work to do here. I c'cannot join you.
LENNY30 - I'm h'happier than a bull b'brahmin in a pasture-full o' cows! I'd b'be honored to j'join you. I m'may be old and I cain't m'move t'too darn fast, leastwasy not for too long, b'but I kin sure p'patch you up when y'you need it.
LENNY31 - I h'help H'harold administer the town. Th'there's always more p'paperwork to do.
LENNY32 - You d'didn't have enough m'money... b'but I helped y'you out anyway. J'jist c'cant stand to see p'people in p'pain.
LENNY33 - There are s'so many p'people here. You d'don't need my h'help, anymore. G'good-luck to you.
LENNY34 - What seems to be the t'trouble? Your t'ticker ain't g'givin' out on you now, is it?
LENNY35 - Heh. No need to get t'tetchy, now.
LENNY36 - Well, mostly, it's just c'common sense stuff. Eatin' right, steerin' c'clear of the harder c'chems, that sorta thing. K'keepin' stress to a m'minimum. B'basically, livin' m'more like an old l'lady, and less like... well, us. Heh. O'course, the b'best thing you could d'do would probably be to t'tamp it down with some c'cardiac regulators, m'maybe some v'vasodilators.
LENNY37 - Let's see, now... (Lenny mutters to himself as he reads over the label.)
LENNY38 - Heart pills. I guess what they're p'puttin' out in Vault City and NCR these d'days ain't much different than w'what we were usin' b'back before the w'war. Strong m'medicine. G'get a fella on that stuff, he'd have the h'heart of a m'mutant m'marathon runner. Heck, if he minded his d'doc and took 'em r'regular-like, he could probably live on hot b'buttered chems and n'not have to worry about it skippin' a s'single b'beat. Uh, n'not that I'd recommend that sort o' thing, of course. D'doctors orders are always supposed to be c'clean livin' and p'plenty of r'roughage, right?
LENNY39 - They could be j'just the thing, now that you m'mention it. In fact, I think they w'would be. He'd hafta be careful about a c'coupla' things, though.
LENNY40 - Nothin' that'd be likely to c'come up t'too often. They've been known to c'cause dizziness. And y'you shouldn't t'take 'em with g'grapefruit juice, though I d'don't think that's gonna be m'much of a p'problem, these days. Unless that's what those l'lumpy g'green things are supposed to be. Hmmm... (Lenny puts a hand to his chin and stares off into space).
LENNY41 - S'sorry. Oh! One more b'big one. Unless you're l'lookin' to meet a l'less-than-d'dignified end, you *do not* want to g'go mixin' those things with N'new Reno p'pep pills.
LENNY42 - Ayup. Y'know, for when your l'little t'trooper won't st'stand at attention? T'technical n'name for 'em was "PDE-5 inhibitors" but t'times bein' what they are, and N'new Reno bein' what IT is... Anywho, where was I?
LENNY43 - Ayup. Y'know, for when a man's l'little t'trooper won't st'stand at attention? T'technical n'name for 'em was "PDE-5 inhibitors" but t'times bein' what they are, and N'new Reno bein' what IT is... Anywho, where was I?
LENNY44 - Oh, yeah. You g'get those two into your s'system together, and KER-BLAM! Your heart'll explode like a b'blood s'sausage. I remember d'doin' p'post-mortems on m'more than one poor g'geezer who was t'too b'busy sowing his oats to r'read a w'warning label.
LENNY45 - Oh. Heh. Musta b'been a little before your t'time. Sorry. Anything else I can d'do for you?
LENNY46 - Wh'what d'do you w'want me to do?
LENNY47 - I'm d'doing fine.
LENNY48 - I have a minor w'wound but I can keep g'going.
LENNY49 - That's a g'good idea. I w'was wondering when we'd s'stop for that. I'm h'hurtin' fer c'certain.
LENNY50 - I need healing now or I'm g'gonna die.
LENNY51 - Oh, okay. I'll w'wait right here until you g'get back. G'give me a chance to r'rest my aching j'joints.
LENNY52 - Okay.
LENNY53 - I'll s'stick c'close to you.
LENNY54 - I g'guess we d'don't want to m'make too easy a t'target huh?
LENNY55 - Okay, I'll s'stay a b'bit farther off. S'seems like people mostly want to k'kill you, anyways.
LENNY56 - TEMP MESSAGE: DISTANCE
LENNY57 - Well, okay, but I sure don't want to be left all alone here.
LENNY58 - TEMP MESSAGE: GEAR
LENNY59 - All right, if you think it's really a good idea.
LENNY60 - TEMP MESSAGE: REMOVE ARMOR
LENNY61 - Gosh I hope I won't need that.
LENNY62 - TEMP MESSAGE: CAN USE...
LENNY63 - Well, I don't like to use weapons unless I really have to, but I suppose I could use a knife, I think. I can use a pistol, at least I used to be able to. If I really had to, I think I could handle a submachine gun. If only they weren't so loud. I'm a healer, not a fighter.
LENNY64 - Well, I don't like to use weapons unless I really have to, but I suppose I could use a knife, I think. I can use a spear, at least I used to be able to. If I really had to, I think I could handle a rifle. If only they weren't so loud. I'm a healer, not a fighter.
LENNY65 - Y'know, I th'thought it w'would be nice to t'travel around with y'you. But you're j'jist an ornery and c'cantankerous as a bull b'brahmin with a c'cactus up its ass. And you don't s'smell much b'better, either. B'dee-ya, b'dee-ya, goodbye.
LENNY66 - There are s'so many p'people here. You d'don't need my h'help anymore. G'good-luck to you.
LENNY67 - I never th'thought I'd live to see the d'day when I'd be ashamed to b'be p'part of what you're doing. You're a d'disgrace to the Vault Dweller's m'memory. B'dee-ya, b'dee-ya, goodbye.
LENNY68 - I w'wasn't sure you'd come back.
