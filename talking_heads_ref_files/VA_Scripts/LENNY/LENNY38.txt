Heart pills. I guess what they're p'puttin' out in Vault City and NCR these d'days ain't much different than w'what we were usin' b'back before the w'war. Strong m'medicine. G'get a fella on that stuff, he'd have the h'heart of a m'mutant m'marathon runner. Heck, if he minded his d'doc and took 'em r'regular-like, he could probably live on hot b'buttered chems and n'not have to worry about it skippin' a s'single b'beat. Uh, n'not that I'd recommend that sort o' thing, of course. D'doctors orders are always supposed to be c'clean livin' and p'plenty of r'roughage, right?
