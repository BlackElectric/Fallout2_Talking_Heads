We call this place the 'Squat' because it was settled by the homeless of many cities. It's not much, but it's all we have. To the west is a city called the NCR. They've known about us for quite some time, and never offered us any kind of help or hindrance. Now, they are suddenly claiming this area as their ancestral home, and they want it back.
