I have a daughter named Chrissy who's a bit of a tomboy. She likes to run around, explore, and pretty much stick her nose into things. Chrissy's a good kid, though. She doesn't cause trouble, she's always home on time and she's shown herself to be a very responsible young lady. I let her do as she pleases most of the time. Last week Chrissy didn't come home. I've asked around, and nobody's seen or heard from her. I tried to find her myself, but Zeke, he's... sort of the mayor here... stopped me. He said it wasn't safe for me to go out looking on my own; he'd have some of his men do it. They couldn't find her, either, and said that maybe the slavers got her.
