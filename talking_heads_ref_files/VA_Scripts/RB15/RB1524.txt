I find it hard to believe that Darion is such a monster after all he's been doing for us. And to think, we've been helping him hide his operations as a raider. I can guarantee you we won't stand for it any longer. I'll talk to Zeke and explain everything. I'm sure he'll want to see you. You should go talk to him later.
