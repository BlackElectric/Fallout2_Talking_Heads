My daughter has told me everything. I find it hard to believe that Darion is such a monster after all he's been doing for us. And to think, we've been helping him hide his operations as a raider. I can guarantee you we won't stand for it any longer. I've already talked to Zeke, and he wants to see you. You should go see him now.
