Slavers hurt me, but I far from broken. The spirits guided you to ensure my freedom. Clearly, the spirits be planning something big for me. Spirits got big plans for you, too. And brother Sulik. He will be much missed, but the spirits say his place is walking by-and-by with you. Hell, even Grampy Bone like you, so I know Sulik in good hands. You take care.
