ANNA1 - Oh, the pain! It burns so!
ANNA2 - I stop and knock at every door, but no one comes, no one hears.
ANNA3 - Where is it? I cannot find it! I am lost! Oh....
ANNA4 - My locket! It is gone. Thief! Thief!
ANNA5 - Oh, cruel fate.
ANNA6 - My locket! Give it to me!!! Oh!!!!
ANNA7 - My locket, my locket! I'm coming, Daddy! I'm coming!
