RAUL1 - Sorry, man, but I don't have time to chit-chat, you know? I got to get this bird working.
RAUL2 - Quincy, huh? Well, Raul don't want to see him, man. Raul is tired of his shit, you know?
RAUL3 -  Hey man, Raul don't take no shit from nobody. You see Quincy working on these birds? No way, man. Only Raul works on these babies. You know why? Cause Quincy don't know DICK, man, that's why!
RAUL4 - Hey, sorry, man. Raul shouldn't be yelling at you, you know? It's not your fault; you're just the messenger. Hey, man, you busy right now?
RAUL5 - Hey look, man. Raul's going to go pay Quincy a visit, you know? Raul's going to clean the old man's clock. You stay here and watch Raul's birds. Ok?
RAUL6 - Hey, thanks, man. Raul owes you one! Don't go away and, hey, man, if anybody screws with Raul's birds, you shoot them in the ass. Ok?
RAUL7 - Hey man, what you think you doing? Get the fuck away from that bird, man! Raul's got enough problems without you grunts fucking with things, you know? Damn flyboys are bad enough!
RAUL8 - Hey, man, Raul told you to keep the fuck away from his birds, man. Now Raul has to teach you to listen. Come on, man. Take off the fucking armor and go one on one, mano e mano with Raul.
RAUL9 - Then don't fuck with Raul's birds, man! Get out of here!
RAUL10 - Hey, man, it's in the locker over there. Take it and tell the doc Raul says hi.
