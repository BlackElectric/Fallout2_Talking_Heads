I'm not sure I believe you, but here's your pay. Hell, if you been lying, my boys will find you. I also said I'd give you some information, so here it is. I've heard a lot of stories about Tandi and the Vault Dweller. Seems he saved her life years ago before NCR was even founded. Anyway, legend has it that he spent a lot of time exploring a vault east of here. If that isn't Vault 13 then maybe you'll find a clue there that will lead you to it.
