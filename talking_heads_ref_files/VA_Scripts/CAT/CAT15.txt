I used to be the guard for one of the genetics labs. They were messing with human and feline DNA. Trying to make something with the best of both worlds, I suppose. And that's where yours truly comes in. [Cat flashes you his toothy grin.] They wanted a volunteer for one of their projects. It was for scouts and the like, supposed to make you more agile and flexible. I liked the sound of that *leers*. Anyway, they gave me this shot, put me under, and the next thing I knew, I had these teeth, and I felt.... sharper? Kind of predatory.
