All right. I remember stashing the cash somewhere downtown. It's been so many years, though, and the buildings have been built and rebuilt over and over, that I'm not sure exactly where it is. If it helps any, I remember thinkin' I should put it somewhere that wasn't likely to be torn down or plowed over. Somewhere indispensable, ya' know? Good luck to you.
