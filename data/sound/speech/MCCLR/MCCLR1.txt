It's amazing, the mole rat attacks on our patrols suddenly stopped without warning. I don't know how you did it, but I thank you. Also, I shall uphold my end of the bargain -- I'll order Stark to cancel the raid at once. As long as the people of that village pose no threat to Vault City, they'll have nothing to fear from us -- I'll see to that.
