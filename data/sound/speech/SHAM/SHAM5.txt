[He contemplates for a moment, then sighs.] This is rather embarrassing to admit but... You see, I've never actually *believed* in spirits, the afterlife, any of it. I know what you're thinking, what good is a shaman that doesn't believe? It's just that, well, it was either this or I take up a spear and hunt geckos with the warriors. Do I look like a warrior to you? Wait, don't answer that.
