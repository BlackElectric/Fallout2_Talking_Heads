Thorg?! He was the shaman that I served as an apperceive under. Wow, I knew he was a bit of an asshole, but I didn't take him for a slayer of pretty young girls. Hmm, I suppose a guilty conscience helps to explain that drunken midnight swim that lead to his death. So Thorg is a murderer... how bout that...
