Thanks for getting the data we needed from Vault City to optimize this leaky old beast. You're a sly one, no denying it, by cracky. Almost as good a job as I could have done myself. 'Course... if'n you wanna actually *finish* the dang job, just use that disk on the Robot Control Terminal. Understand me? Well, OK then.
