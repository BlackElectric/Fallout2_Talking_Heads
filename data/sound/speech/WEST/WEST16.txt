Well, maybe I can. I've heard a lot of stories about Tandi and the Vault Dweller. Seems he saved her life years ago before NCR was even founded. Anyway, legend has it that he spent a lot of time exploring a vault east of here. If that isn't vault 13 then maybe you'll find a clue there that will lead you to it.
