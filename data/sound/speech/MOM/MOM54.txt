Oh, that's great news! Thank you so much! I just hope no one was hurt in the process. I'll get in touch with some friends and we'll get started right away. If you're still in town a few days from now, you should stop by. Hopefully, we'll have things up and running by then. Oh, I'm so excited! Thanks again. Here, this meal's on me.
