Yes, perhaps you *could* help. You see, I procured a large building over on the south-west side that, with a little work, would make an excellent orphanage. But a bunch of lowlifes are squatting there and refuse to leave unless I pay an absurd fee. Even if I *had* the money, I wouldn't give it to them bullies -- they'd just use it to further poison themselves. I'd go to the authorities, but unfortunately, there's no such thing in the Den. Perhaps you'd have better luck at convincing them to leave?
