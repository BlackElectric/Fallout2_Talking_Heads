It's a shame, isn't it? Those poor children living on the streets like that... A lot of them steal to get by -- from outsiders mostly -- so if you catch one trying to relieve you of something, please take pity on 'em. I'm not saying it's right, but it's a harsh world we live in, and we all do what we have to in order to make it through the day.
