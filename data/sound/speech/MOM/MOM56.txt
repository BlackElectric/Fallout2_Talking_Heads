Hmm... I suppose everyone deserves a second chance. I'll stop over there with some friends and we'll talk things over with 'em. Thank you so much for helping me with this. If you're still in town a few days from now, you should stop by. Hopefully, we'll have things up and running by then. Oh, I'm so excited! Thanks again. Here, this meal's on me.
