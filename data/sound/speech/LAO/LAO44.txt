But there was salvation. After weeks of drifting, the sub finally came to rest out in the shallow waters of the San Francisco bay. This city became our new home. We eventually restored the Shi-Huang-Ti; its targeting systems, its weapons. It has enough firepower to blow any potential invaders out of the water. So even if you got that old tanker running, it wouldn't get far, as the submarine will destroy any non-Chinese vessel that sails through the bay.
