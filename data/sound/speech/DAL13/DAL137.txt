After I left the Squat I didn't know what to do with myself. I figured I'd just drift into another town and another hired gun job... so I was wandering the desert trying to decide exactly where I should go. Well, one day I was looking for a good place to camp. It was getting late, and I didn't want to be out in the open after dark. Off in the distance a ways, I thought I saw a campfire -- so I decided to see who was there.
