So, I sneak up on this camp site and there are these two deathclaws sitting around the fire just chatting away. Idiot that I am, I let out a little cry of surprise, jumped up, and turned to run -- right into the arms of another deathclaw standing right behind me. Anyway, to make a long story short, it took awhile for me to realize that I wasn't about to be put on a spit and barbecued. Instead, I was brought here and 'interviewed' by Gruthar. Now I can live here if I want.
