Well dat wuz a loooong time ago. I haddent quite gotten my act together yet. It waz before th' angel Mrs Wright put me in line. Ya see, them monks didn't take kindly to my wild ways. Me and Brother Samuel, we useta get a lil crazy. Hehe, this one night, Sammy and I went 'round to the sleepin monks, and put their handz in bowls a warm water. Even got the Abbot! Ha! Those were the dayz, lemme tell ya.
