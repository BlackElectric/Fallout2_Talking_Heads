I dunno if I'd say they *kicked* me out... but they zure as hell didn't want me to stick around--not after that night I passed out and axidently set fire to one a th' lieberrys. Boy, you shoulda seen the Abbot's face... if he had half a backbone, he'd a prolly strangled me. Ha! So I left, and good riddenze! I sure do miss that hooch though. And Samuel, it'd be nice ta know how that ol' dog's doing.
