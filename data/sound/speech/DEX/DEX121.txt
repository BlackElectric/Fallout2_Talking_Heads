Alright, basically, ever since I was a kid, I liked to kill things. I could talk about my childhood and my shitty parents and try to analyze why I like to do it, but I don't need an excuse. I do it simply because I can, and it's fun. By the time I was sixteen I spent my days as a popular high school heartthrob, and my nights as a ripper of Chicago's young working girls.
