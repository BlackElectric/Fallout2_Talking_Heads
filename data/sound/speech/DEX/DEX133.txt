So there I was, certain I was going to die, but then these G-Men stepped in and took me away. They got me back to a hundred percent, then started doing these tests on me, trying to figure out what makes me the way I am... Anyway, you can figure the rest, and my throats dry from talking. Damn, I was hoping to avoid that.
