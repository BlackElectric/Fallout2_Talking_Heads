So they put my Dad away and shipped me off to live with my Aunt and Uncle. You see, I was a little hell-raiser, even then, and my Uncle, being a military sort, thought he'd be able to straighten me out-turn me into a Red slaying soldier boy, just like the son he'd lost. He gave it his best shot, but I was a stubborn son-of-a-bitch.
