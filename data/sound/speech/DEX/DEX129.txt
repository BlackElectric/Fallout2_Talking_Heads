I caught her in the act, and I lost it. Things got real brutal. It was sloppy and there was no way I was going to be able to just cover it up. So I set the place on fire and hit the road. Did a lot of traveling, laid a lot of girls and left most of 'em dead. It wasn't a bad life, you know? It took 'em ten years, but the law finally caught up with me.
