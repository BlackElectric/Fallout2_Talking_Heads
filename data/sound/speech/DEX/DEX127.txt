So things were pretty sweet, for the most part. I mean, I fucking hated my Uncle and Aunt, but at school I was Mr. Popular. Every guy wanted to be my friend and every gal I looked at was willing to spread for me. Except for this one gal, Vicky. She actually took a bit of work. Amazing, I know, but eventually I got her to come around and become my girl.
