Let's see.... My Mom was a drug fiend and a whore, and my Dad was an ornery drunken bastard. Fortunately, my grandpa was alright for an old guy. Introduced me to The King's music. Unfortunately, he was claimed by the New Plague when I was seven. Then when I was ten, I watched from the closet as my Dad beat my Mom to death for forgetting to feed our dog, Captain Robeenie.
