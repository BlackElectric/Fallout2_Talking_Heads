So anyway, we did a lot of moving around and it wasn't until I was in high school that we finally settled down in Chicago. That's when I took to sneaking out at night and knifing hookers. I'd been killing things for as long as I could remember, but gutting neighborhood critters didn't compare to the real deal, you know?
