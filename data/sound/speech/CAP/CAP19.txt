If anyone knows what's going on with that sub, it'd be the Shi. The sub's what brought 'em here in the first place I wouldn't be surprised if they worship the thing. The Shi Emperor would know everything, of course, but good luck with that. You'd be better off asking Lao Chou, over at the Flying Dragon eight he's been known to dole out information from time to time. Hell, maybe you could even get one of the dock workers to talk.
